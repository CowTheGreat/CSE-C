# CSE C Section Class Website

## Description

This is a **horribly designed** website for the **CSE C Section** class. It is made with **outdated HTML and bad CSS styling** just for the sake of having a webpage. Nothing is optimized, and responsiveness is **non-existent**.

## Features

- **Ugly Design**
- **Poorly structured HTML & CSS**
- **Terrible color choices (if any)**
- **Inline styles mixed with external styles**
- **No responsiveness because why bother?**

## Installation

1. Download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Be amazed (or horrified).

## Future Improvements (Probably Not)

- Make it **even worse**
- Add **more unnecessary tables**
- Introduce **random flashing colors**

## Contributing

**Donâ€™t.** But if you must, make sure you add **even more bad practices** to keep the spirit of this project alive.

## License

No license, because this shouldn't exist.
